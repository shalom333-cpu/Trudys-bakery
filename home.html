    <p>When I first started baking cakes six years ago, I would search the internet for pictures and recipes that spoke to me.
    I wanted to feel inspired when I saw a cake. I wanted to find a cake that when I looked at it, I fell in love and knew I
    had to make that cake. I’ve pinned dozens and dozens and dozens of cake recipes from a variety of cake blogs and
    websites. I’ve also tried dozens and dozens of those recipes, and have come up with a list of my favorite cake blogs
    that have consistently provided incredible tasting cakes, helpful tutorials and tips, and inspiration for my own
    recipes.
    Here are my favorites:
    Sweetapolita
    First up is Sweetapolita.com. Rosie’s stunning cakes immediately drew me in and her flavors kept me coming back. This
    was really the first cake blog I started following religiously. I first tried her Campfire Delight Cake and was blown
    away by her rich, dark chocolate cake layers she paired with a toasted marshmallow frosting and malted Belgian chocolate
    frosting. It was decadent, mouth-watering, and oh-so memorable. She’s been one of my go-to cake bloggers ever since my
    first bite of that cake. I also love and recommend her Autumn Delight Cake, Triple Lemon Blueberry Cake, and Diner Dream
    Cake. They’ve been HUGE hits every time I’ve made them.
    The Cake Blog
    This next site, The Cake Blog, is made up of a community of bakers and cake designers who share their work, recipes and
    tutorials. Carrie Sellman is the founder of the site and has a line-up of 12 contributors, including Tessa Huff, one of
    my favorite cake creators. I love that The Cake Blog offers recipes from so many different types of bakers. There’s so
    much inspiration on this site, you have to take a look. And one of my favorite recipes from here has been the Peanut
    Butter and Jelly Cake by Tessa Huff.
    Style Sweet CA
    StyleSweetCa.com is Tessa Huff’s cake blog and should definitely be bookmarked on your computer. So many of the recipes
    I ended up trying and loving from The Cake Blog were Tessa’s recipes. I love her flavor combinations and how clearly she
    explains the instructions, assembly, and design of her cakes. You really can’t go wrong with anything she’s created. In
    addition to her Peanut Butter and Jelly Cake, I also recommend her Vanilla Butter Cake, Raspberry Blood Orange Cake,
    Rhubarb Crisp Cake, and her Yellow Cake with Chocolate Fudge.
    Milk Bar
    My love of Milk Bar is deep and continues to grow with every cake I try. Christina Tossi is seriously one of my idols. I
    love how she creates such memorable flavor and texture combinations. I mean, the cookie crumbs! Genius. Pure genius! And
    it makes me so happy that she shares so many of her recipes on the Milk Bar website. My favorite Milk Bar cakes are the
    Birthday Cake and the Apple Pie Cake (which is my new favorite dessert for Thanksgiving!). You can get all the recipes
    and tutorials at MilkBarStore.com.
    Baking a Moment
    More recently, I’ve found and fallen in love with Baking a Moment by Allie, a former pastry chef. From cupcakes and
    brownies, to macarons and torts, to cakes and cookies, this site is sure to become one of your go-to sources for all
    things spots. I also love how she wants to make baking fun and simple. Her recipes are easy to follow, and are total
    crowd pleasers. Allie’s coconut cake recipe helped inspire my Coconut Cream Cake, and I was a huge fan of her Chocolate
    Cake with Mexican Hot Chocolate Frosting.
